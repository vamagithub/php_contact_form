# php_contact_form
This is a PHP based contact form. Type in your query and send it to mail using php mail() function 

If you want to change GUI i.e. basic look and feel of your contact form, edit Index.html file accordingly .
Make sure you dont change the " name " ID of the variables used , incase if you want to change then do change in contact.php variables .


Thank You!
